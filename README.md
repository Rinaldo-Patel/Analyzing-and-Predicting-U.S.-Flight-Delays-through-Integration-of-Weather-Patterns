# Analyzing-and-Predicting-U.S.-Flight-Delays-through-Integration-of-Weather-Patterns

The project entails combining U.S. airline data with weather data for data-driven analysis and prediction of flight delays. It constructs a dataset through PySpark, BigQuery, including data engineering workflows, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model evaluation, and insights on operational and weather-related delay factors.

## Problem Statement
Flight delays pose significant operational, economic, and logistical challenges for airlines, airports, and passengers. While adverse weather is widely recognized as a major contributor to delays, its predictive impact is difficult to quantify due to sparse station coverage, temporal variability, and complex interactions with flight operations. This project addresses the problem of integrating large-scale meteorological data with U.S. airline on-time performance records to determine how daily weather patterns influence delay outcomes and to develop machine learning models capable of predicting delays exceeding 15 minutes. The goal is to build a scalable data pipeline, identify the most influential weather and operational factors, and evaluate the extent to which weather information can enhance delay prediction accuracy in real-world settings.

### Executive Summary 

The aim of this project is to investigate the root causes and patterns of flight delays within the United States using large-scale operational and meteorological data. The investigation shall emphasize how weather, airline operations, and temporal factors together drive flight punctuality and lay a foundation for predictive modeling. An integrated dataset was generated by combining records of airlines and weather from 2021 to 2024. Using Google Cloud Platform tools, we cleaned, validated, and merged more than twenty-six million flight records with day-by-day weather attributes. Thereafter, such infrastructure allowed performing efficient computation, correlation analysis, and visualization at the national level.

### Objectives

- Large-Scale Data Integration and Preparation: Integrate the BTS Airline On-Time Performance dataset with NOAA's GSOD weather data for 2021–2024 using BigQuery and PySpark to create large-scale, integrated data for analysis.

- Analyze Delay Patterns and Trends: Identify monthly, hourly, and airline-specific delay behaviors, distinguishing between short, long, and weather-related delays.

- Assess weather influence: Quantify the effects of temperature, visibility, wind speed, and other factors like snow, dew, gusts on delay probabilities and frequency.

- Build Predictive Readiness: Establish clean, joined datasets and exploratory insights for machine learning models to predict delays exceeding 15 minutes.

### Key Findings

- Overall Delay Rates: About 20% of flights were delayed more than 15 minutes, and distributions in delay duration show frequent extreme delays beyond 200 minutes.
Temporal and Seasonal Trends: Summer months (June–August) showed the highest average delays and delay frequencies, while fall exhibited the lowest. Hourly trends showed that late-night and early-morning flights face elevated weather-related delays.

- Airline Performance: The low-cost carriers, Frontier F9 and JetBlue B6, had the highest delay rates, while major carriers such as Delta DL and Alaska AS had stronger on-time performance.

- Airport Insights: Major hubs like Dallas–Fort Worth, Chicago O'Hare, and Charlotte showed the highest weather-related delay volumes, pointing out that these airports are sensitive to congestion.

- Weather Correlations: Poorer visibility and higher wind speeds are highly correlated with higher delay rates. Delay rates fell precipitously as visibility improved beyond 10 miles. Inter-variable correlations showed that temperature, precipitation, and visibility were the most important meteorological factors; the operational metrics of carrier, month, and departure hour were the strong secondary predictors.

These results reaffirm that delay behavior is jointly driven by both operational and environmental variables. The following stage will deal with the predictive modeling aspect using machine learning methods to classify and forecast delays exceeding 15 minutes. The more general objective is to create a scalable data-driven framework that would assist airlines and airport authorities in anticipating disruptions, optimizing scheduling, and enhancing passenger reliability through informed, proactive decision-making.

Based on these findings, airlines and airport operators should implement targeted weather-based scheduling buffers at high-risk hub airports during peak summer months, prioritize congestion mitigation strategies during late-night and early-morning operations, and apply real-time monitoring thresholds for wind and visibility to trigger proactive gate, crew, and fleet adjustments. Deployment of the forthcoming machine-learning delay-risk models as decision dashboards will enable day-of-operation risk forecasting to reduce cascading delays and improve passenger reliability.
